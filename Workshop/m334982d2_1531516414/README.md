NS2+
==========
This Natural Selection 2 mod aims to improve, fix and expand the game in order to bring players a better experience. It contains extra customization options and quality of life improvements. This mod needs to be installed on the server.

You can check some of the recommended settings [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQfwDi5IGCg).

Latest changes
==============
- 13/7/2018
    - Fixed that the used team victory probability formula was incorrect. (Thanks Las)
    - Fixed that the team victory probability was displayed even if one team doesn't have any players yet.
    - Fixed that the observatory scoreboard link wasn’t using https. (Thanks Morrolan)
    - Reset the hive skill related server options. Server operators can re-enable them via sv_plus.
    
- 7/4/2018
    - Fixed a script error that could occur opening the ns2+options in-game
    - Fixed that predict conflicted with the weapon slot mode of the alien ability select option.

- 4/6/2018
    - Replaced all Elixer methods with the new DebugUltility methods
    - Added an option to choose how to select alien abilities. This allows to select metabolize to be selected as weapon once again.
      - Todo:
        - I'm planning to expand this feature to support all abilities and  pure key bound ability activation.
        - Additionally currently selecting metabolize has a short delay due to the way the weapon select is handled at the server side.

Server settings
===============
Server operators can adjust some features for NS2+ through the console (typing "sv_plus" in console), or change them in the NS2PlusServerSettings.json file located in the server config folder.
- Enable/Disable client features
	- **allow_ambient:** Enables or disables the ability to disable map ambient sounds for clients.
	- **allow_mapparticles:** Enables or disables the ability to disable the map particles for clients.
	- **allow_nsllights:** Enables or disables the ability to use the NSL lights for clients.

- Server features
	- **autodisplayendstats:** Enables or disables the end game stats displaying automatically upon game end.
	- **endstatsteambreakdown:** Enables or disables the end game stats displaying the full team breakdown. This is the table with kills, deaths, accuracy, etc.
	- **modupdater:** Enables or disables the mod update checker. This will notify players that mods running on the server have been updated during the round and that new players cannot join until the map is changed. If the server is using a mod backup server it will display a different notification.
	- **modupdatercheckinterval:** Sets the update check interval for the mod updater (in minutes).
	- **modupdaterreminderinterval:** Sets the time between reminders when an update has been found. Set to 0 to disable (only shows once).

	- **showplayerskill:** Shows each player's Hive skill on the scoreboard before the game starts.
	- **savestats:** Saves the last round stats in the NS2Plus\\Stats\\ folder in your config path in json format. Each round played will be saved in a separate file. The file name for each round is the epoch time at round end. Disabled by default.

Stats format
============
For the modders or people interested in making use of the stats gathered by NS2+, they can either call CHUDGetLastRoundStats() after the round has ended (it updates the data on NS2Gamerules:EndGame()), or use the "savestats" server option, which will give them access to the tables that NS2+ uses to store the info during the round that gets sent to the players at the end of the game.

**Locations**

This table will store an array with the location names, the index of each entry will be used in the other tables to refer to each location in order to save some space.

For example in "Locations":["North Tech","South Tech"], North Tech would be referred as 1, and South Tech as 2.
