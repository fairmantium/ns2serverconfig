--[[
	Optimises a pair of teams by minimising the difference in average
	"skill" and standard deviation of "skill".

	Skill is defined by whatever function is provided.

	The method used is roughly the following:

	1. Start with two lists of players, one for each team. Make sure the average skill, total skill,
	   and number of players is already known.

	2. Run through the team with more players (or team 1 if both teams are equal size), and
	   work out what the average skill and standard deviation of skill for both teams will be
	   when each player is swapped with every player on the other team. If one team is larger,
	   also consider moving each player from the larger team onto the smaller team.

	3. If a simulated swap produces an improvement found acceptable, add it to a list of potential swaps.

	4. Once all possible swaps are enumerated, sort them by average difference ascending, standard deviation
	   difference descending. This creates something like this (average, standard deviation):

	   { 10, 100 }, { 10, 50 }, { 10, 20 }, { 30, 70 }, { 30, 40 }, { 50, 10 }

	5. Choose the last entry in the sorted list, and perform the swap defined.

	6. Go back to step 2 and repeat until the list of allowed swaps is empty.

	This method produces a slow, but steady path towards an optimal solution. It keeps chipping away at the average
	bit by bit, while never choosing a standard deviation that's too high.
